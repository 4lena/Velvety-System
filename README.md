## About The Project

Velvety System is a web-based management system that is designed to facilitate communication and streamline the request approval process between employees and managers. The system allows employees to add requests, such as leave or party requests, which are then routed to their respective managers for approval. The manager can approve or decline the request from within the system. Velvety System provides an easy-to-use interface that allows employees to quickly submit requests and managers to efficiently review and approve them.
